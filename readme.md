#Simple-Timerbar
This is a simple timerbar I used in a project.

#CSS That I learned/Reviewed
*-webkit-animation-name: fillbar; /* Chrome, Safari, Opera */ AND animation-name: fillbar;
..* This gives the name for the @keyframes animation

#Other techniques used
*touch readme.md
..* This is to create files in the terminal/commandl prompt

*mkdir dirname
..* Makes a directory

#Purpose of this project
To get more familiar with git and other coding practices. To show members of BC some basics.
